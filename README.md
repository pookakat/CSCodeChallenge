# CSCodeChallenge

The challenge, write an application that's either a command line entry or forward facing that takes the bill from a meal and returns a tip. So far, this app:
Takes an amount. You have the ability to put in any number of decimal places when it comes to putting it in, but the app will round to the nearest hundreth.
Calculates 3 different tips:
Ok, 15% - again, rounds the tip to the nearest hundreth and returns that number to two decimal places
Good, 20% - ditto
Great, 25% - again, it does the stuff.
