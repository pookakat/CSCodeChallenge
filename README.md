# CSCodeChallenge

The challenge, write an application that's either a command line entry or forward facing that takes the bill from a meal and returns a tip. So far, this app:
Takes an amount. You have the ability to put in any number of decimal places when it comes to putting it in, but the app will round to the nearest hundreth.
Calculates 3 different tips:
Ok, 15% - again, rounds the tip to the nearest hundreth and returns that number to two decimal places
Good, 20% - ditto
Great, 25% - again, it does the stuff.

Things that are required but are not met yet:
a negative bill amount (why??)
a zero bill amount (coupon maybe?)

Future plans: 
Add submit button
Decide on whether to just show buttons for Ok, Good or Great OR just a submit button then reveal those buttons
Regardless, calculate only tip level pressed
Possibly write the ability to put in your own great tip percentage
MAYBE add a "I was thinking of leaving X. Is it a good tip?"
Look for an API that allows the user to scan their receipt for the computer to take it
Make it pretty
